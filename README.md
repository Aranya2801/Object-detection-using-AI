# Object-detection-using-AI
Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects within an image or video. It is a fundamental task in computer vision, with many applications in fields such as robotics, self-driving cars, and security systems.

In recent years, deep learning-based object detection has become the standard technique for achieving state-of-the-art results. The most popular deep learning-based object detection algorithms are region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), including faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLO (You Only Look Once).

To perform object detection, we need to train a model on a dataset of labeled images, where each object of interest is annotated with a bounding box and a label. The model is then trained to predict the label and bounding box of objects in new images.

In this project, we will be using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, which is a real-time object detection system. We will be using the pre-trained YOLOv3 model and the OpenCV library to perform object detection on images and videos.

The steps involved in this project are:

Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights and configuration files from the official website.

Load the model using OpenCV's dnn module.

Load the image or video and resize it to the input size required by the model.

Pass the image or video through the model to obtain the predicted bounding boxes, object classes, and confidence scores.

Filter the predictions by confidence score and non-maximum suppression (NMS) to obtain the final set of bounding boxes.

Draw the final set of bounding boxes on the image or video and display the result.

To run the project, you will need the following software installed:

Python 3.6 or later
OpenCV 4.0 or later
Numpy
You can install OpenCV and Numpy using pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy
To download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights and configuration files, you can use the following command:

ruby

wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
wget https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg?raw=true -O yolov3.cfg
Once you have downloaded the required files and installed the necessary libraries, you can run the script to perform object detection on an image or video.

Example usage:

css

python object_detection.py --image input_image.jpg --output output_image.jpg
python object_detection.py --video input_video.mp4 --output output_video.avi
In the above examples, the --image and --video arguments specify the input file, and the --output argument specifies the output file. If the --output argument is not specified, the result will be displayed on the screen.

You can also adjust the confidence threshold and NMS threshold using the --confidence and --nms arguments, respectively.

Overall, object detection using AI is a fascinating and powerful technology with many applications in the real world.
